# Contributing to ArtAgents

Thank you for your interest in contributing to ArtAgents! Your feedback and ideas are valuable as this project evolves.

As ArtAgents is currently a prototype developed primarily by an individual, please keep in mind that response times or feature implementation priority may vary.

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions in the following forms:

*   **Reporting Bugs:** If you find a bug, please open a detailed GitHub Issue.
*   **Suggesting Features:** Have an idea for a new agent, workflow strategy, UI improvement, or core feature? Open a GitHub Issue to discuss it.
*   **Improving Documentation:** Found typos or areas for clarification in the README or other documentation? Small fixes via Pull Requests are welcome, but for larger changes, please open an issue first.

## Reporting Bugs

Before reporting a bug, please check the existing [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/your-username/ArtAgent/issues) to see if it has already been reported.

If not, please open a new issue and include:

*   A clear and descriptive title.
*   Steps to reproduce the bug reliably.
*   What you expected to happen.
*   What actually happened (include console output or screenshots if relevant).
*   Your operating system and ArtAgents version (if known).

## Suggesting Features

We are open to new ideas! Please open a GitHub Issue to suggest a feature and include:

*   A clear and descriptive title.
*   A detailed description of the proposed feature and why it would be useful.
*   (Optional) Any thoughts on potential implementation approaches.

Discussing features via issues first helps align ideas before any code is written.

## Code Contributions (Pull Requests)

While code contributions are appreciated, **please adhere to the following process to avoid wasted effort:**

1.  **Open an Issue First:** Before starting work on any code changes (bug fixes or new features), please **open a GitHub Issue** to discuss the proposed change. This allows for discussion on the approach, feasibility, and alignment with the project's goals.
2.  **Fork & Branch:** Once the change is agreed upon in the issue, fork the repository and create a new branch for your work.
3.  **Develop:** Make your code changes. Ensure code is clear and reasonably commented. (Consider adding tests if applicable for significant logic changes - Testing framework setup is planned).
4.  **Submit Pull Request:** Open a Pull Request (PR) against the `main` branch of the original ArtAgent repository.
    *   Provide a clear title and description for your PR.
    *   **Link the PR to the original GitHub Issue.**
    *   Explain the changes you made and why.

**Important Notes on Code PRs:**

*   **Issue Link Required:** PRs without a corresponding discussion issue may be closed.
*   **Focus:** Please keep PRs focused on a single issue or feature.
*   **Trivial Changes:** While minor documentation typo fixes might be accepted directly via PR, substantial code changes (even bug fixes) require an associated issue. Pull requests making only trivial, non-functional code changes (e.g., single-letter variable name changes without justification) are unlikely to be merged.
