# ArtAgents Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for ArtAgents.

## What is ArtAgents?

ArtAgents is a prototype framework designed for artists, designers, researchers, and creative individuals to experiment with local language models (LLMs) served via Ollama. It allows you to:

*   Interact with LLMs through specialized **AI Agents**, each with a unique persona and task focus.
*   Build and run multi-step **Agent Teams** (workflows) for complex prompt generation or text processing tasks.
*   Manage and generate **Image Captions**.
*   Conduct systematic **Experiments (Sweeps)** across different models and agent configurations.
*   Customize application settings, models, agents, and teams via accessible configuration files.

The goal is to provide a flexible and powerful local environment for exploring the capabilities of agent-based AI systems in creative contexts.
