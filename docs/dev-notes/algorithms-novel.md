**Standard Synthesis Strategies (Often Aiming for Coherence/Accuracy)**

1.  **Simple Concatenation:**
    *   **How:** Join texts end-to-end (A + B + C).
    *   **Result:** Raw, potentially disjointed, preserves all info but lacks integration. Often poor for GenAI prompts unless the model is good at parsing unstructured input.
2.  **Labeled Concatenation:**
    *   **How:** Join texts with labels identifying the source ("Perspective A: [...] Perspective B: [...]").
    *   **Result:** More structured than simple concatenation, preserves attribution. Can work as a prompt if the GenAI understands the structure, but might be verbose.
3.  **Hierarchical Summary:**
    *   **How:** Generate a brief overarching summary, then detail points from each agent, possibly with attribution. (Uses an LLM for summarization/structuring).
    *   **Result:** Balanced overview, good for understanding, preserves key details. Prompt quality depends on the summary's effectiveness.
4.  **Thematic Integration:**
    *   **How:** Identify common themes across A, B, C. Structure the output around these themes, weaving in agent details. (Requires LLM analysis).
    *   **Result:** Coherent, integrated view focusing on shared concepts. Good for creating focused prompts, but might lose unique outlier details.
5.  **Comparative Analysis:**
    *   **How:** Explicitly highlight similarities, differences, and contrasts between A, B, and C. (Requires LLM reasoning).
    *   **Result:** Emphasizes relationships between perspectives. Can create complex prompts highlighting tension or specific feature comparisons.
6.  **Aspect-Based Synthesis:**
    *   **How:** Break down the subject by aspects (e.g., color, texture, mood). Synthesize information for each aspect from relevant agents. (LLM or rule-based).
    *   **Result:** Highly structured output, good for detailed control if aspects align with prompt engineering needs. Can be rigid.
7.  **Narrative Weaving:**
    *   **How:** Construct a single story or descriptive passage incorporating key elements from A, B, C in a logical flow. (LLM-driven).
    *   **Result:** Fluent, often engaging text. Good for prompts aiming for a specific scene or atmosphere. Might sacrifice technical accuracy for narrative coherence.

**Novel & Creative Combination Strategies (Exploring Unexpected Outcomes)**

These often involve instructing the Manager LLM in more unusual ways, leveraging its generative capabilities beyond simple synthesis.

8.  **Metaphorical Synthesis:**
    *   **How:** Instruct the Manager LLM to explain the combined essence of A, B, C's descriptions *using a specific metaphor* (e.g., "Describe the combined input as a 'stormy sea'," or "Explain the core ideas using a cooking metaphor").
    *   **Result:** Highly interpretive, abstract prompts. Can yield unexpected visual connections and stylistic blends. Excellent for breaking creative blocks.
9.  **Conceptual Blending:**
    *   **How:** Explicitly ask the Manager LLM to *blend* the core concepts from A, B, and C into a *new, hybrid concept* or image description. (e.g., "Blend the technical details from A with the emotional tone of B and the historical context of C into a single fantastical object description").
    *   **Result:** Can generate truly novel ideas by forcing disparate concepts together. High potential for surreal or unique outputs.
10. **Stylistic Mashup / Textual Style Transfer:**
    *   **How:** Combine the *content* derived from A, B, C, but instruct the Manager to render the final text in a completely *different and specific style* (e.g., "Synthesize the inputs into a prompt written as a Shakespearean sonnet," "as technical documentation," "as a cryptic prophecy," "as a cheerful children's story").
    *   **Result:** Juxtaposes content with an unexpected stylistic frame. Can dramatically alter the mood and interpretation, leading to visually interesting results.
11. **Dialectical Amplification / Tension Maximization:**
    *   **How:** Instead of resolving differences (like Comparative Analysis), instruct the Manager to *exaggerate the conflicts, contrasts, or tensions* between the perspectives of A, B, and C. Frame it as a debate or highlight the paradoxes.
    *   **Result:** Prompts emphasizing dynamic opposition, contrast, or unresolved energy. Useful for creating visually dramatic or conceptually challenging images.
12. **Stochastic Excerpts / Cut-Up Technique:**
    *   **How:** Algorithmically (or via LLM instruction) select random phrases, sentences, or keywords from A, B, and C. Combine these fragments, perhaps with minimal connective tissue generated by the LLM. (Inspired by Burroughs' cut-up technique).
    *   **Result:** Potentially nonsensical but serendipitous combinations. Can break established patterns and introduce surprising juxtapositions. High chance of failure, but occasional brilliance.
13. **"Sensory Translation" Synthesis:**
    *   **How:** Ask the Manager LLM to describe the combined information from A, B, C as if perceived through a different sense (e.g., "What would this collection of ideas *sound* like?", "Describe the *texture* or *taste* of this combined description").
    *   **Result:** Extremely abstract and metaphorical prompts. Pushes the GenAI to interpret concepts synesthetically.
14. **Instructional Inversion / "Describe the Opposite":**
    *   **How:** Synthesize the core ideas from A, B, C, and then instruct the Manager to describe the *conceptual opposite* or a scenario where these elements are *absent* or *inverted*.
    *   **Result:** Explores negative space and contrast conceptually. Can lead to prompts defining something by what it's *not*.
15. **Chain-of-Thought Synthesis Prompt:**
    *   **How:** Instruct the Manager not just to synthesize, but to *output its reasoning process* for combining A, B, and C as part of the final prompt. (e.g., "Considering A's point on X and B's view on Y, I will combine them by emphasizing Z, resulting in: [Actual Prompt]").
    *   **Result:** Complex prompts where the rationale *might* influence the GenAI subtly, or at least provide meta-context. Might be too verbose.

**Implementation in ArtAgents:**

*   These strategies can be implemented as selectable options (`stage2_synthesis_strategy` in your proposed team structure).
*   Many novel strategies rely heavily on crafting specific system prompts or user instructions for the "Manager" LLM agent.
*   Some (like Stochastic Excerpts) might involve additional Python logic outside the LLM call.
*   Experimenting with different Manager LLMs (e.g., one tuned for creativity vs. one tuned for factual summarization) for the same strategy could also yield diverse results.

These novel approaches move away from simply representing the input towards using the synthesis step as a generative stage in itself, deliberately introducing transformation, interpretation, and creative friction â€“ perfect for design exploration where the journey and unexpected discoveries are often as valuable as the final destination.
